# Proof of Achievement for Milestone 4

I'd like to send the conclusion of our Milestion 4 - Bitcoin Integration.

We've released the integration in our latest version 1.21.1, which allows users to manage their Bitcoin wallet along with the Cardano one. Every user will have both accounts, Cardano and Bitcoin, under the same seed phrase.

As for this Milestone, the video below covers Create, Sign and Track of a Bitcoin transaction.
